# This is a WIP
I have a working version that uses shell scripts, but this is the "real programming language" rewrite.

# qute-ssb
## Why?
[Qutebrowser](https://github.com/qutebrowser/qutebrowser) is good.
Site-specific browsers are good.
Why not put them together?
## But qutebrowser is poorly suited for a lot of single-page web apps
Yes.
For video players like Netflix or chat apps like Slack (*hiss*),
you'll probably be using the keyboard to control the app more often than to control qutebrowser.
But qutebrowser is better than Firefox and Chromium even in passthrough mode.

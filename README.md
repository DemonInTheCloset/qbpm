### This project is effectively dead

`qute-ssb` (not an accurate name) is a qutebrowser profile creator.
The main use case is sharing a single symlinked config between multiple profiles
with separate histories and sessions. However, I'm no longer actively working on
it, mainly because I haven't been able to come up with a sane interface.
I still think it's a good idea and I might revisit it in the future, but this
version is basically an overgrown script full of assumptions based on my own
system, and about half of it is the command line specification.
